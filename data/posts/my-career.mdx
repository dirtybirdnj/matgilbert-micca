In 2004 / 2005 I was jetissoned from the education system into the real world. Ultimately I moved back home to NJ from RI where I was going to school.

It took me a few months of sitting around and getting bored, but eventually I found a job at a local kayak store and made myself useful.

After that I worked at a company in NYC after a good friend got me an interview. It was my first experience working for a startup company.

The startup was interesting, but there was zero room to spread my wings. Efforts to add efficiency and remove drudgery and toil from my workplace were actively thwarted. It wasn't the place for me. The commute killed me, not worth it but the allure of NYC was there.

After the startup, I found myself still living in NJ but working in NJ was less painful. The tech wasn't as exciting, but at least there was somewhat interesting work. I built a custom interface to a messaging app for blackberries (remember those?). I built a really cool integration
with the first ever API I interacted with, the Magic Logic CubeIQ API. Still to this day one of the most fun things I worked on.

Unfortounately the local job was not a stable one, in a meeting where the CEO explained oncoming bankruptcy challenges he completely failed to assauge the crouds fear of "what happens if we don't get bought." At least he did not sway me. I was gone in a month, and everybody else got
fired.

The next job was one of the best, working for a small weather company in NJ. I made some cool friends and geniuntely made the orginzation a better place through added features during my time there. Things fell apart when the person who was the barrier between me and management left.

I can't deal with "business owner" types that do not treat their employees with respect. If an employees work generates tons of revenue they should get some cut of that. It should not all go to some asshole sales person who did no work, was not involved and actively resisted involvement.

Needless to say while I loved my time at that compnay, there were some unprofessional experiences towards the end that soured me. Like getting called out on being on job hunting websites by the head guy. Not cool. Find a better way to address the issue.

"Boss" behavior is often not leadership, completely the oppsoite actually.

Escaping the weather company in NJ led me back to NYC. I thought getting a job at a big company would show me "how the big boys" did software, and boy was I wrong. I found how slow, thoughtless and callously mechanic "corporate" america can be. I had project managers BRAG about their
lack of competence, as if this was somehow a shield for accountability from the shit thier bad decisions rained down on me. I had contractors and employees LITERALLY engage in screaming mactches over my cubicle. I had a co-worker of foreign nationality leave food in his desk (that shared my cube) for Over
a week. I had to dispose of the rotting food because it was goign to make me throw up. Our boss was non-existant, when he did show up he was out of touch and clueless.
